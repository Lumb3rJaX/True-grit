# True-grit

this is a repo for a bot I made back in 2015/16 as a part of a discord community that I am no longer active in. THERE ARE A LITERAL METRIC CRAP TON OF ERRORS IN THIS BOT.

I have included it here as a reminder of what the bot was capable of, as it was my first time using large varialbes and lists to power a function. See the "shakespear insult generator" that is towards the bottom of the code. 
This was something I worked on for a while and am still quite proud of because I was able to build it solo, with minimal help. This bot helped to insprire me to learn more about code.
